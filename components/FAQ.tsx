    question: "Do you accept insurance?",
    answer: "No, but a superbill is provided for self-submission to your insurance company for potential reimbursement. Many clients find that their insurance covers a portion of out-of-network therapy costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Are online sessions available?",
    answer: "Yesâ€”all virtual sessions are conducted via secure Zoom meetings. Online therapy provides the same level of care and effectiveness as in-person sessions, with the added convenience of attending from your comfortable space."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "24-hour notice is required for all cancellations or rescheduling. Sessions cancelled with less than 24 hours notice will be charged the full session fee, except in cases of emergency."
